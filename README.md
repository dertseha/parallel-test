This is a test project to try out parallelization libraries

## Setup
To build the project, you need [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/)

### Using CMake
Generate your project files with
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
Then run your build tool with the generated files. The unit-tests need to be run manually.
